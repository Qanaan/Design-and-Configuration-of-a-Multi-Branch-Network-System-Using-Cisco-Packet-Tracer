# Design-and-Configuration-of-a-Multi-Branch-Network-System-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This project shows how I designed and set up networks for four different office branches (KL, Penang, Ipoh, and Malacca), and made sure they can all communicate with each other.


🔧 What I did:

🖧 Built local networks (LANs) for each branch using star topology 🌟

🌍 Connected all branches through a wide area network (WAN)

🧠 Created custom IP addressing schemes with subnetting (VLSM)

🛠️ Configured static routing, RIP v2, and NAT for routing and security

📶 Integrated IoT devices like smart doors 🚪, lights 💡, fans 🌬️, and more

🏢 Designed each department with unique requirements in mind (IT, Finance, Sales, Marketing)

💻 Simulated and tested everything using Cisco Packet Tracer 🧪
